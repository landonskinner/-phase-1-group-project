## NHL Fantasy App
As my first major project, the NHL Fantasy App was built using vanilla Javascript and the Bootstrap framework. Using the National Hockey League (NHL) API, this application displays relevant statistics for all players across the league. With the ability to find players by team and filter by position, the user can curate the perfect fantasy lineup by favoriting their desired players. Designed with a mock backend that is hosted on Heroku, the app allows favorites to persist for the user to view at any time.
